      <h2>Free Software vs Open Source Software</h2>
      <p>Free software and open source software (collectively referred to as FOSS) are  two of the most popular concepts in the programming community. The free software movement has been around for some time now and open source has become a popular methodology in today’s world. Calling free software a movement and OSS a concept was deliberate.</p>
      <p>To start decoding the ambiguity surrounding the two terms, we have to go back to how open source was derived from free software. Free software does not stand for software or codes that are free of cost, although most softwares produced under the free software license are free. This ambiguity was the primary reason for the establishment of OSS. But the OSS became a concept quite different from its parent by developing its own sets of values, philosophy and methodology. </p>
      <p>Now, lets look at some differences between Free Software and Open Source Software.
      <table id="diff">
      <tr>
      <th>Free Software</th>
      <th>Open Source software</th>
  </tr>
      <tr>
  <td>  Free Software is accessible at no expense and is a typical class of little applications accessible for downloading and utilize in many operating systems.</td>
  <td> Open source software alludes to software that individual can share and modify as the design of this software is publicly available.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>The “freeware software” term was censured for the ambiguity of “free” as “accessible at no cost”, which was seen as disheartening for business adoption, and for the authentic questionable utilization of the term.</td>
  <td>The expression “open source” encourages an ambiguity of an alternate kind to such an extent that it confounds the simple accessibility of the source with the opportunity to utilize, change, and redistributes it.</td>
  </tr>
        <tr>
    <td> This focuses on providing a moral/ethical argument for OpenSource.</td>
    <td> This tends to focus on providing an economic/business argument for FreeSoftware.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Using/providing FreeSoftware is a good, morally right, thing to do.</td>
    <td>Using/providing OpenSource Software is beneficial to one / one's business".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>eg:</span> Whatsapp is a freeware , but you cannot get source code of that app to modify as your own.</td>
    <td><span>eg:</span> Android is Open source which is built on another open source Linux Kernal.</td>
